# 💳 Credit Card Default Prediction with Machine Learning

**Author:** Quan Yuan  
**Notebook:** `p17-credit_card_default_prediction.ipynb`  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment based on personal and transaction features. It involves a full data science workflow from data exploration and cleaning to modeling and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand patterns in customer behavior related to default risk
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for modeling
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key features
- Train and evaluate machine learning classifiers

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure


---

## 🔍 Key Components

- 📊 **EDA**: class balance, default distribution, feature impact
- 🧹 **Preprocessing**: missing value imputation, encoding, scaling
- 🧠 **Modeling**: logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods
- 📈 **Evaluation**: confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, precision-recall analysis

---

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Most default cases occurred among users with prolonged late payments across multiple months  
- Limit balance and education level showed moderate correlation with default risk  
- Class imbalance observed — addressed via stratified sampling or resampling techniques

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- `pandas`, `numpy` — data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — data visualization  
- `scikit-learn` — machine learning modeling and evaluation
